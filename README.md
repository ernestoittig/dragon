# Purpose of this project
The Dragon language in _The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim_ or Dovahzul is filled with
missed opportunities and is basically a relex of English grammar without tense and pro-drop.

What I'm going to attempt is to make a new conlang for the dragons in Skyrim with
a bit more thought put into it.

Keep in mind this is my first conlang so my abilities may be sloppy.

# How Dovahzul failed
One of the things that really bothers me is the use of bilabial, labiodental and
and dental consonants when dragons clearly lack lips and front teeth.

So /p/, /b/, /m/, /f/, /v/ and /θ/ are sounds dragons shouldn't be able to do.

Some other sounds may be unviable beacause of their small, thin tongue, as seen
[here][dragon_tongue] but that would be nitpicking.

## Grammar

Dovahzul didn't have a tense, like many other conlangs in The Elder Scrolls, but
I believe other interesting features related to the origins of the dragons could have 
been added to the grammar.

## Origins
Dovazhul sounds like a nordic/old germanic language. This makes it cool, however, it
doesn't make sense given the origin of the dragons. For an outsider to The Elder 
Scrolls, it might seem like dragons are just beasts, but in the lore, it is said that
dragons are like angels, for a lack of a better word, the children of Akatosh, the god
of time.

Dragons are described as intelligent and consider the non-dov "weak minded". I think a
more complex, less crude language would be more fitting for the dragons, because of their
celestial powers.
